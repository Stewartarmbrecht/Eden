## Deploying Content Reactor

Content Reactor can be built and deployed into your own Azure subscription. 
You can use VSTS to run builds and releases, or if you prefer, 
you can run the build and deployment steps manually. 
We assume that you have an Azure subscription available to run the sample; 
[you can get a free trial Azure subscription here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

This guide explains the steps to build and deploy Content Reactor, 
both using VSTS and manually. 

For instructions on building and deploying the Content Reactor manually see the
setup instructions [here](scripts/setup.md).

For instructions on building and deploying the Content Reactor with VSTS see the
setup instructions [here](vstssetup.md).
